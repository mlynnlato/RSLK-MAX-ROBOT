# RSLK-MAX-ROBOT

Lab Objective:
The objective so the lab were to build two variation of testing using the light sensors beneath the
robot. These were utilized to follow a pre-defined black track. These test will help further help
with understanding on how the light sensors follow a path and calibrate. 

Part 1:
Fully assembled TI-RSLK MAX vehicle will follow a straight, then curved, then straight line. The downward facing IR sensors and wheel encoders are used for this part of the lab.  The vehicle should stop when it reaches a 10cm perpendicular line. 

Part 2:
Using the same 3 papers,  a box is placed at the perpendicular line at the end of the part 1â€™s path. The robot will again, follow the line, then stop 15 cm before the box. Then turn right 90 degrees, and run the robot in an approximate circle with a diameter of 50 cm. The robot should stop at the same point it started to run in a circle.
